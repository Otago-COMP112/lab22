        <h3>The South Island League</h3>
        <p>
            The year long South Island League is going well. In the last round Dunedin travelled to Invercargill.
            A good win there for Dunedin against the hapless Invercargill with the sending off of Darren Carson for
            talking back to the ref giving Invercargill a brief glimmer of hope almost immediately extinguished by
            two quick goals from Dunedin. Further north Christchurch were far too strong for Nelson and romped home
            7 - 1. It was much more finely balanced for us against Timaru and I was seriously worried for a while.
            But then an inspired individual goal by Sam broke the spirit of Timaru and they never really threatened
            for the rest of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years the game has matured and spread, it is now played in upwards of 40 countries including
            the U.K, most of Europe, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, North America and some S.E Asian countries.
